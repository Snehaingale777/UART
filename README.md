# UART
UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter. It is a hardware communication protocol that facilitates serial communication between devices. Unlike other communication protocols like I2C or SPI, UART does not require a clock signal, making it asynchronous. Instead, it uses a start bit, data bits, an optional parity bit, and stop bits to format data transmission.
